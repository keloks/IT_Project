ITAcademy project  
The 'Punks.txt' is a file that contains all the punks with their class, attributes and current owner.  
The files '0.txt', '1.txt' etc contain the history of transactions for the corresponding punk.  
For example '0.txt' contains the transactions for the punk number 0, '1.txt' for the number 1 punk etc.  
TODO: Get price only in dollars. Change date format? Change file format to csv?
